Compound keywordslike "each morning" or "nowhere $ near" , should not begin or end with space. This could be fixed in matchTOK() but is not currently allowed.

All keywords should be lower case (see VAR.findInText())

You can put space around before and after keywords, but not two spaces.

Do not use LOGIC_OP subvariables as variables of your narratives. It surely will confuse the engine.


We have: K = NarReader( E, m)
Where E = the EXPERIENCE tree
and   m = event( BARRIER, NOISE, TRANSPARENCY )

After reading text="windows shut out the noise"

>>> print K.tree.PrintSimple() [THIS SHOWS THE TREE]

A good way to set calibrs for .setCalibration( calibs ):
For each nar in reader, use ">>>>print nar.str()" to see the default settings of the nar. 
Calibrate appropriately. 
For example:
"problem" is a nar with the str()
T:problem
R:nullN
A:nullK
V:noise
 - clearly when this is said it is bad, so calib needs to be True, to flip interpretation
