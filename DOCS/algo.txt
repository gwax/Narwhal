algorithm:

First pass: semantic based splitting:

 - If there are any client NARs that are "SO"s, try them at each possible position in the text where there is a "so" word [incuding "and"]. Score them.

 - If there are any client NARs that are "AND"s, try them at each possible position in text where there is a "and". Score them.

Second pass: text form based splitting followed by more semantic handling

 - if there are any "splitter" words IN THE TEXT, try the appropriate split pattern
   if:        if A CONJ_OP B
   but:       A BLOCK_OP B
   although:  FWDHEDGE A CONJ_OP B
   although:  A FWHEDGE B

With each of these we need to try all the other client NARs in positions A and B

 - Otherwise submit all other client  NARs to all of text




Fumbling:
You can stage a narrative for vaulting whenever it begins to be detected in the text. Once staged it can be updated regularly. Then a trigger even occurs and the narrative, complete or not, goes into a segondary staging area. It can still be negated but probably no longer is updated. The trigger could be that the narrative was completed, or that a control word occurred.
