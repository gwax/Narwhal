There was a faded charm about this hotel. FANTASTIC staff, very welcoming nothing was too much trouble,recommending resturants,shopping places to visit. Internet connection is claimed for all rooms but we found that the thickness of the walls did not make this always possible. but the hotel lobby had very good connection. So hurry visit Naples start your day staying in this hotel and fill up with an excellent continental breakfast. We cant wait to return

The drawbacks:
- only wifi in the lobby.
- poor tv and remote control
- AC is kind of slow (therefore it can be kind of hot in the room)
- they dont wash the towels, unless u pay extra (they normally wash'em once a week or so)
- quite a stretch to walk to the beach, 5 mins to the beach and maybe 10 back.
- the staff don't speak very good english
- the breakfast is not so cheap, staff is not service oriented
- if u dont speak russian, there may be serious problem in the communication
