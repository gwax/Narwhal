The smell of mould was so bad we thought we would be sick the entire time. The bathroom in this room was pretty horrible too. Blue everywhere, and very reminiscent of a 70s sitcom. We went back to reception and requested another room which, to their credit, they gave us. It was in the newer section of the hotel and it was much better. There was not the overwhelming smell (although after coming home each day there was a very mild mould smell - maybe from the air conditioning).

Breakfast was a buffet style which was OK but nothing to rave about. You could order eggs or pancakes to your style which was good because there was not too much else on offer.

Don't expect any luxury and be prepared to smell the horses and camels outside your window.

You'll be able to have breakfast with a stunning view on the Pyramids and the Sphinx (and see all the hawkers interact with the tourists below).

Though i suggest to avoid rooms with pyramids view. It's very noisy outside, people are shouting all night, riding the horses, etc.
