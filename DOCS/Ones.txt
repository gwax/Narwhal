Fell into bed exhausted but there is a continuing dreadful racket as the central heating starts up ever few minus and makes a huge noise and whine and there is no switch that works to switch it off.

So blissfully quiet my wife was overjoyed (had suffered disturbed sleep in Firenze..whilst I slept like a log).
 
We did find it a bit noisy with the balcony doors open due to the McDonalds next door - especially late at night and at 6 am when the deliveries started arriving.
 
The street outside was a busy one with a popular wine bar so a little noisy with the windows open
 
Think they start cleaning early as woken up at 6 by clanking and clattering. Continued to dose, but stirred every five minutes because of the not so quiet maids. We had read that this is a soundproofed hotel, but it doesn't seem that way.
 
Although my room was next to the elevator, it was perfectly quiet and dark at night so I was able to sleep much better than most European cities.
 
Our room faced the small street outside which meant we could open a window without any air con noise from courtyard - street very quiet, so good sleep quality!
