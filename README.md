Narwhal is a Python Module for Natural Language Processing using methods of geometry rather than statistics. It defines text aware classes that can read text from a narrow world and perform sentiment analysis. A narrow world is a collection of related topics with many short text examples. For example TripAdvisor hotel reviews are a narrow world with roughly 30 common topics such as noise, wifi, service, nearby attractions, food, transportation, etc. This concept of a narrow world is essentially the same as a “semantic frame” as described by Fillmore [Fillmore]; however the process for extracting what has been said is implemented using the general method of “Best Model Classification” and “The Elements of Narrative” [WAKSMAN]. Use Narhwal to build specialized chatbots.
