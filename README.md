# Narwhal
Narwhal is an open source Python extension for creating text-aware classes that can read text from a narrow world. A narrow world is a collection of related topics with many short text example. For example TripAdvisor hotel reviews are a narrow world with roughly 30 common topics such as noise, wifi, service, nearby attractions, food, transportation, etc. This concept of a narrow world is essentially the same as a “semantic frame” as described by Fillmore [Fillmore]; however the process for extracting what has been said is implemented using the general method of “Best Model Classification” [Waksman, in Pattern Recognition Research] and the semantic patterns formalized in “The Elements of Narrative” [Waksman, in IOSRJEN].
