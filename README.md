Narwhal is a keyword and key NARRATIVE manager that creates text aware classes. This is simple Natural Language Understanding (NLU) without Natural Language Processing (NLP). Narhwal is a geometric, rather than statistical approach to language. It embeds detailed topic knowledge which is called "narrow world language processing". The concept of a narrow world is essentially the same as a “semantic frame” as described by Fillmore [Fillmore] and archived at Berkeley's "FrameNet".
