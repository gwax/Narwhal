Narwhal is a class library for Natural Language Processing. It uses client defined key words and key narratives to initialize text aware classes, applying methods of geometry rather than statistics. Narwhal classes can read text from a narrow world and perform sentiment analysis or simple data extraction. 

A narrow world is a collection of related topics with many short text examples and a underlying information model. For example TripAdvisor hotel reviews are a narrow world with roughly 30 common topics such as noise, wifi, service, nearby attractions, food, transportation, etc; and the information model is the hotel and its attributes. To read text from a narrow world, a client can focus on domain specific knowledge, while Narwhal does the text processing. For example, use Narhwal to build specialized chatbots rather than all purpose ones. 

The concept of a narrow world is essentially the same as a “semantic frame” as described by Fillmore [Fillmore] and archived at Berkeley's "FrameNet"; however the process for extracting what has been said is implemented using the general method of “Best Model Classification” and “The Elements of Narrative” [WAKSMAN].

Other spellings (for the fussy GitHub search engine) trip advisor, trip-advisor, chatbot, nlp, frame net, keyword, keynarrative
