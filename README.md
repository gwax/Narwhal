Narwhal is a library of objects that can read text available to a Python client. It uses keywords based on client-provided synonym lists and also client-provided formulas in the keywords. So the client can focus on the details of the topic vocabularies and how people express themselves about the topics. After that client's will need to write code that transfers information from the Narwhal objects into more convenient data structures. 

Narwhal is a simple form of Natural Language Understanding. It does not do Natural Language Processing or parts of speech and it is a geometric, rather than statistical approach to language. The Narwhal approach is to embed detailed topic knowledge, in what is called "narrow world language processing" where that "narrow world" is essentially the same thing as a “semantic frame” as described by Fillmore and archived at Berkeley's "FrameNet".
