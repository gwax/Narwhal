These web pages show the kinds of results you will get from Narwhal. They are from an old noise reader, long before Narwhal. I assume Narwhal works better now but we'll see. There is no accounting [actually there is] for when someone writes "shower heard" meaning "shower head". 

GitHub makes the html load as text so I guess to examine the web page you'll need to download it with its associated files.
