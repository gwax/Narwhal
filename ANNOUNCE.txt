V2.0 release created. I now have enough confidence to delete v1.

Version 2 now working pretty much as desired. Questions with AD HOC solutions
are creeping in in several places: the gof() depends a bit on segment structure
the vault thresholds on vaulting rather than on setting the pre. Both V1 and V2
will continue in parallel for a bit longer. Speedup is phenomenal.

Narwhal version 2 is running - may need further debugging and 
definately still needs wrapping  with "App" totality. But there 
is now, at least, a new stake in the ground. The concept of 
segmented text, replacing tokenized text, is going well.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Jan 20: Version 1 uses direct text processing, which leads to the same 
KList lookups occurring over and over - completely inefficiently. 
It was my goal for the code to be true to an intuition about the 
"moving topic", so pre-processing the text wasn't allowed. Now for 
performance, I must revisit the decision. As we move beyond Version 1, 
I am afraid I am moving past intuition and needing to conceptualize 
entities that are not directly intuitive. In particular concepts of 
'token' need to be replaced with concepts of filled VAR. A sequence of 
tokens is replaced by a sequence of filled VARs called a "segment". 
All other operations, up to the NWReader, need to be re-written using 
segmented text.

But I have to develop new intuitions for segments. They will be the 
"spatial curves" to which we fit the moving frames of narrative.

Version 1 of Narwhal is Complete

IT HAS SEVERE PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS. I am redesigning it to replace reading 
of text with conversion of text to "segmented indexing" and reading of the 
segmented data. That way only one time through the dictionaries will be 
needed.

Stay tuned as we try to see what kind of "release label" I can apply here 
on GitHub.
UPDATE: done, now there is a "release" folder on the main page.
